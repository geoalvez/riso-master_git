[Stephen Grover Cleveland] (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was the 22nd and 24th President of the [United States]. He was the winner of the popular vote for [president] three times – in 1884, 1888, and 1892 – and was one of the two [Democrats] (with Woodrow Wilson) to serve as president during the era of Republican political domination dating from 1861 to 1933. He is the only President in American history to serve non-consecutive terms in office and the only President to win the popular vote more times was Franklin Roosevelt.

[Cleveland] was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, Free Silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for [political reform] and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American [conservatives] of the era. Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. He relentlessly fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. Indeed, as a reformer his prestige was so strong that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called "Mugwumps", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the [1884 election].
