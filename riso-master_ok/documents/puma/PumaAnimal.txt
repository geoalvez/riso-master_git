[Puma] is a genus in [Felidae] that contains the [cougar] (also known as the puma, among other names) and the jaguarundi, and may also include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives (for example, Puma pardoides, or "Owen's panther," a large cougar-like cat of Eurasia's Pliocene).

The [puma] is a large, secretive [cat]. They are also commonly known as cougars and mountain [lions], and are able to reach larger sizes than other "big" cat individuals. Though despite their large size, it has been believed that they are more closely related to smaller feline [species]. There are 7 subspecies of puma, all of which have similar characteristics but tend to vary in color and size. Pumas are thought to be one of the most adaptable of [felines] on the American continents, for the fact that they are found in a variety of different habitats unlike other various cat species.
