2003: [Invasion]

The [first Central Intelligence Agency invasion team] entered [Iraq] on [July] 10, 2002
 This [team] was [composed of members] of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by [members] of the US [military]'s elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)
 Together, they [prepared] for the [invasion of conventional forces]
 These [efforts] consisted of persuading the [commanders of several Iraqi military divisions] to surr[end]er rather than oppose the invasion, and to identify all of the [initial leadership targets] during [ve]ry [high risk reconnaissance missions]

Most importantly, their [efforts] [organized] the [Kurdish Peshmerga] to [become] the [northern front] of the invasion
 Together this force [defeated] Ansar al-[Islam] in [Iraqi Kurdistan] prior to the invasion and then [defeated] the [Iraqi army] in the north
 The [battle] against Ansar al-[Islam] [led] to the [death] of a [substantial number of militants] and the unco[ve]ring of a [chemical weapons facility] at [Sargat]

At [5]:34 AM [Baghdad] [time] on [March] 20, 2003 (9:34 p
m
, [March] 19 EST) the [military invasion of Iraq] began
 The 2003 [invasion of Iraq], [led] by US [army General Tommy Franks], began under the codename "[Operation Iraqi Liberation]", later renamed "[Operation Iraqi Freedom]", the [UK] codename [Operation Telic], and the Australian codename [Operation Falconer]
 [Coalition forces] also [cooperated] with [Kurdish Peshmerga forces] in the north
 Approximately forty [other] [government]s, the "[coalition] of the willing," [part]icipated by providing [troops], [equipment], [services], [security], and [special forces]

The [stated objectives] of the invasion were; [end] the [Hussein regime]; eliminate whate[ve]r [weapons of mass destruction] could be [found]; eliminate whate[ve]r [Islamist militants] could be [found]; obtain [intelligence] on [militant networks]; distribute [humanitarian aid]; secure [Iraq]'s [petroleum] [infrastructure]; and assist in creating a [representative] but [compliant government] as a [model] for [other Middle East nations]

The invasion was a [quick] and [decisive operation encountering major resistance], though not what the US, [British] and [other forces expected]
 The [Iraqi regime] had [prepared] to [fight] both a [conventional] and [irregular war] at the [same time], conceding [territory] when [faced] with [superior conventional forces], [large]ly armored, but launching [smaller scale attacks] in the [rear using fighters] [dressed] in [civilian] and [paramilitary clothes]
 This [achieved] some [temporary successes] and [created unexpected challenges] for the [invading forces], especi[ally] the US [military]

In the north, OIF-1 [used] the [large]st [special operations] force since the [successful attack] on the [Taliban government of Afghanistan] just o[ve]r a [year] earlier
 The [Iraqi army] was [quick]ly [overwhelmed] in each [engagement] it [faced] with US [forces], with the [elite Fedayeen Saddam] putting up strong, some[time]s suicidal, [resistance] before melting a[way] into the [civilian population]

On [April] 9 [Baghdad] fell, [end]ing President [Hussein]'s 24-[year] rule
 US [forces] [seized] the [deserted] Ba'ath [Party ministries] and [stage]-managed the tearing down of a huge [iron statue of Hussein], [photos] and [video] of which became [symbol]ic of the [event], although later contro[ve]rsial
 In [November] 2008, [Iraqi protesters] [stage]d a [similar stomping] on and burning of an [effigy] of George W
 [Bush]
 The [abrupt fall of Baghdad] was [accompanied] by a [widespread outpouring of gratitude] to[war]d the [invaders], but also [massive civil disorder], including the [looting of public] and [government buildings] and drastic[ally] [increased crime]

According to the [Pentagon], 2[5]0,000 [short tons] (230,000 t) (of 6[5]0,000 [short tons] ([5]90,000 t) total) of [ordnance] was [looted], providing a [significant source of ammunition] for the [Iraqi insurgency]
 The [invasion phase] [concluded] when [Tikrit], [Hussein]'s [home] [town], fell with [little resistance] to the US [Marines of Task Force Tripoli] and on [April] 1[5] the [coalition] [declared] the invasion effecti[ve]ly o[ve]r

In the [invasion phase] of the [war] ([March] 19-[April] 30), 9,200 [Iraqi combatants] were [killed] along with 7,299 [civilians], primarily by US air and [ground forces]
 [Coalition forces] [reported] the [death] in [combat] of 139 U
S
 [military personnel] and 33 [UK military personnel]
 This [worked] out at almost 100 [dead Iraqis] for e[ve]ry [dead coalition soldier]


[Coalition Provisional Authority] and [Iraq Survey Group]

Shortly after the invasion, the [multinational coalition] [created] the [Coalition Provisional Authority] ([CPA]) Ø³Ù„Ø·Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø¦ØªÙ„Ø§Ù? Ø§Ù„Ù…ÙˆØ­Ø¯Ø©, [based] in the [Green Zone], as a [transitional government of Iraq] until the [establishment] of a [democratic government]
 Citing [United Nations] Security Council Resolution 1483 ([May] 22, 2003) and the [laws of war], the [CPA] [ve]sted itself with [executive], legislati[ve], and [judicial authority] o[ve]r the [Iraqi government] from the [period] of the [CPA]'s inception on [April] 21, 2003, until its [dissolution] on [June] 28, 2004

The [CPA] was origin[ally] [headed] by [Jay Garner], a [form]er U
S
 [military officer], but his [appointment] lasted only until [May] 11, 2003 when [President Bush] ap[point]ed L
 Paul [Bremer]
 [Bremer] ser[ve]d until the [CPA]'s [dissolution] in [July] 2004

An[other] [group] [created] by the [multinational force] in [Iraq] post-invasion was the 1,400-member international [Iraq Survey Group] who [conducted] a [fact]-finding [mission] to find [Iraq]i [weapons of mass destruction] (WMD) [programmes]
 In 2004 the ISG's Duelfer Report [stated] that [Iraq] did not ha[ve] a [viable WMD program]


Post-[invasion phase]

On [May] 1, 2003, [President Bush] [stage]d a [dramatic visit] to the [aircraft] carrier USS Abraham Lincoln operating a few [miles west of San Diego], [California]
 The [visit] climaxed at [sunset] with [Bush]'s now well-[know]n "Mission Accomplished" [speech]
 In this nation[ally] [televised speech], [delivered] before the [sailors] and [airmen] on the [flight deck], [Bush] effecti[ve]ly [declared] [victory] due to the [defeat] of [Iraq]'s [conventional forces]
 Howe[ve]r, [former President Hussein] remained at [large] and [significant pockets of resistance] remained

After [President Bush]'s [speech], [coalition] [forces] noticed a gradu[ally] increasing [flurry of attacks] on its [troops] in [various regions], especi[ally] in the "[Sunni Triangle]"
 The [initial Iraqi insurgents] were [supplied] by [hundreds of weapons caches created] prior to the invasion by the [Iraqi army] and [Republican Guard]

Initi[ally], [Iraqi resistance] ([described] by the [coalition] as "Anti-[Iraq]i Forces") [large]ly stemmed from [fedayeen] and [Hussein]/Ba'ath Party loyalists, but soon [religious radicals] and [Iraqis angered] by the [occupation] contributed to the [insurgency]
 The three [province]s with the [highest number of attacks] were [Baghdad], [Al Anbar], and [Salah Ad Din]
 Those three [province]s account for 3[5]% of the [population], but are responsible for 73% of U
S
 [military deaths] (as of [December] [5], 2006), and an e[ve]n [higher percentage] of recent U
S
 [military deaths] (about 80%
)
[Insurgents use guerrilla tactics] including: [mortars], [missiles], [suicide attacks], [snipers], improvised explosi[ve] devices (IEDs), [car bombs], [small arms fire] (usu[ally] with [assault rifles]), and RPGs (rocket [propelled grenades]), as well as [sabotage] against the [petroleum], [water], and [electrical infrastructure]

Post-invasion [Iraq] [coalition] [efforts] commenced after the [fall] of the [Hussein regime]
 The [coalition nations], together with the [United Nations], began to [work] to establish a stable, compliant democratic [state capable of defending] itself from non-[coalition] [forces], as well as o[ve]rcoming [internal divisions]

Meanwhile, [coalition military forces] [launched] [several operations] around the [Tigris River peninsula] and in the [Sunni Triangle]
 A [series of similar operations] were [launched] throughout the [summer] in the [Sunni Triangle]
 To[war]d the [end] of 2003, the [intensity] and [pace of insurgent attacks] began to [increase]
 A [sharp surge] in [guerrilla attacks] ushered in an [insurgent effort] that was [termed] the "[Ramadan Offensive]", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim [holy month of Ramadan]

To [counter] this [offensive], [coalition] [forces] begin to use [air power] and [artillery] again for the [first time] since the [end] of the invasion by striking [suspected ambush sites] and [mortar launching positions]
 [Surveillance of major routes], [patrols], and [raids] on [suspected insurgents] were [stepped] up
 In [addition], two villages, including [Hussein]'s birthplace of al-Auja and the [small town of Abu Hishma] were [surrounded] by [barbed wire] and carefully [monitored]

Howe[ve]r, the [failure] to [rest]ore [basic services] to pre-[war levels], where o[ve]r a [decade of sanctions], US and [UK bombing], [corruption], and decaying [infrastructure] had [left] [major cities] barely functioning, contributed to [local anger] at the [IPA government]


[Hunting] down the [Hussein regime]

In the [summer] of 2003, the [multinational forces] [focused] on hunting down the [remaining leaders] of the [former regime]
 On [July] 22, a [raid] by the US 101[st Airborne Division] and [soldiers] from [Task Force] 20 [killed] [Hussein]'s sons (U[day] and [Qusay]) along with one of his [grandsons]
 In all, o[ve]r 300 [top leaders] of the [former regime] were [killed] or [captured], as well as [numerous lesser functionaries] and [military personnel]

Most significantly, [Saddam Hussein] himself was [captured] on [December] 13, 2003 on a [farm] near [Tikrit] in [Operation Red Dawn]
 The [operation] was [conducted] by the [United States Army]'s 4th [Infantry Division] and [members of Task Force] 121
 Intelligence on [Saddam]'s whereabouts came from his [family members] and [former bodyguards]

With the [capture of Hussein] and a [drop] in the [number of insurgent attacks], some [concluded] the [multinational forces] were prevailing in the [fight] against the [insurgency]
 The [provisional government] began [training] the [new Iraqi security forces] [intended] to [police] the [country], and the [United States] promised o[ve]r $20 billion in [reconstruction money] in the [form of credit] against [Iraq]'s [future] [oil revenues]
 [Oil revenue] was also [used] for rebuilding [schools] and for [work] on the [electrical] and [refining infrastructure]

Shortly after the [capture of Hussein], [elements] [left] out of the [Coalition Provisional Authority] began to agitate for [elections] and the [formation] of an [Iraqi Interim Government]
 Most prominent among these was the [Shia] cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani
 The [Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections] at this [time]
 The [insurgents] [stepped] up their [activities]
 The two most [turbulent centers] were the [area] around [Fallujah] and the poor [Shia sections of cities] from [Baghdad] ([Sadr City]) to [Basra] in the south


2004: [Iraq]i Resistance expands

The [start] of 2004 was [marked] by a [relative lull] in [violence]
 [Insurgent forces] reorganised during this [time], [study]ing the [multinational forces]' tactics and [planning] a [renewed] [offensive]
 Howe[ve]r, [violence] did [increase] during the [Iraq Spring Fighting] of 2004 with [foreign fighters] from around the [Middle East] as well as al-Qaeda in [Iraq] (an affiliated al-Qaeda [group]), [led] by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi helping to dri[ve] the [insurgency]

As the [insurgency] grew there was a [distinct change] in [target]ing from the [coalition] [forces] to[war]ds the new [Iraq]i [Security Forces], as [hundreds of Iraqi civilians] and [police] were [killed] o[ve]r the [next few months] in a [series of massive bombings]
 An [organized Sunni insurgency], with [deep roots] and both [nationalist] and [Islamist motivations], was becoming more powerful throughout [Iraq]
 The [Shia Mahdi Army] also began launching [attacks] on [coalition targets] in an [attempt] to seize [control] from [Iraqi security forces]
 The [southern] and [central portions of Iraq] were beginning to erupt in [urban guerrilla combat] as [multinational forces] [attempted] to keep [control] and [prepared] for a [counteroffensive]

The most [serious fighting] of the [war] so far began on [March] 31, 2004, when [Iraqi insurgents] in [Fallujah] ambushed a [Blackwater USA convoy] [led] by four US [private military contractors] who were providing [security] for [food caterers Eurest Support Services]
 The four [armed contractors], [Scott Helvenston], [Jerko Zovko], [Wesley Batalona], and [Michael Teague], were [killed] with [grenades] and [small arms fire]
 Subsequently, their [bodies] were [dragged] from their [vehicles] by [local people], [beaten], [set] ablaze, and their [burned corpses] hung o[ve]r a [bridge] crossing the [Euphrates]
 Photos of the [event] were [released] to [news agencies] worldwide, causing a [great deal of indignation] and [moral outrage] in the [United States], and prompting an unsuccessful "pacification" of the [city]: the [First Battle of Fallujah] in [April] 2004

The [offensive] was [resumed] in [November] 2004 in the bloodiest [battle] of the [war] so far: the [Second Battle of Fallujah], [described] by the US [military] as "the heaviest [urban combat] (that they had [been] [involved] in) since the [battle of Hue City] in [Vietnam]
" [Intelligence briefings] [given] prior to [battle] [reported] that [Coalition forces] would en[counter] [Chechnyan], [Filipino], [Saudi], [Iran]ian, Italian, and [Syrian combatants], as well as [native Iraqis]

During the [assault], US [forces] [used] [white phosphorus] as an [incendiary weapon] against [insurgent personnel], attracting [controversy]
 The 46-[day] [battle] [result]ed in a [victory] for the [coalition], with 9[5] US [soldiers] [killed] along with approximately 1,3[5]0 [insurgents]
 [Fallujah] was tot[ally] [devastated] during the [fight]ing, though [civilian casualties] were low, as they had mostly f[led] before the [battle]

An[other] [major event] of this [year] was the [revelation of widespread prisoner abuse] at [Abu Ghraib] which [received international media attention] in [April] 2004
 [First reports] of the [Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse], as well as [graphic pictures] showing US [military personnel] taunting and [abusing Iraqi prisoners], came to [public attention] from a 60 Minutes II news [report] ([April] 28) and a Seymour M
 Hersh article in the The [New Yorker] (posted on[line] on [April] 30
) [Military correspondent Thomas Ricks] claimed that these [revelation]s dealt a blow to the [moral justifications] for the [occupation] in the [eyes of many people], especi[ally] [Iraqis], and was a turning [point] in the [war]


200[5]: Elections and [transitional government]

On [January] 31, [Iraqis] [elected] the [Iraqi Transitional Government] in [order] to draft a [permanent constitution]
 Although some [violence] and a [widespread Sunni boycott marred] the [event], most of the [eligible Kurd] and [Shia populace] [part]icipated
 On [February] 4, [Paul Wolfowitz] announced that 1[5],000 US [troops] whose [tours of duty] had [been] ext[end]ed in [order] to provide [election security] would be [pulled] out of [Iraq] by the [next month]
 [February] to [April] pro[ve]d to be relati[ve]ly [peaceful months] [compared] to the [carnage of November] and [January], with [insurgent attacks] a[ve]raging 30 a [day] from the prior [average of] 70

[Hopes] for a [quick end] to the [insurgency] and a [withdrawal] of US [troops] were [dashed] in [May], [Iraq]'s bloodiest [month] since the invasion
 [Suicide bombers], [believed] to be mainly [disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs], [Syrians] and [Saudis], tore through [Iraq]
 Their [targets] were often [Shia gatherings] or [civilian concentrations of Shias]
 As a [result], o[ve]r 700 [Iraqi civilians] died in that [month], as well as 79 US [soldiers]

The [summer] of 200[5] saw [fight]ing around [Baghdad] and at [Tall Afar] in [northwestern Iraq] as US [forces] tried to seal off the [Syrian border]
 This [led] to [fight]ing in the [autumn] in the [small towns] of the [Euphrates valley] between the [capital] and that [border]

A [referendum] was [held] in [October] 1[5] in which the [new Iraqi constitution] was [ratified]
 An [Iraqi national assembly] was [elected] in [December], with [participation] from the [Sunnis] as well as the [Kurds] and [Shia]

In[surge]nt [attacks] [increased] in 200[5] with 34,131 [recorded incidents], [compared] to a total 26,496 for the [previous year]


2006: [Civil war] and [permanent Iraqi government]

The beginning of 2006 was [marked] by [government creation talks], growing [sectarian violence], and continuous anti-[coalition attacks]
 Sectarian [violence] [expanded] to a [new level of intensity following] the al-Askari Mosque [bombing] in the [Iraqi city of Samarra], on [February] 22, 2006
 The [explosion] at the [mosque], one of the holiest [sites] in Shi'a [Islam], is [believed] to ha[ve] [been] ca[used] by a [bomb] [planted] by al-Qaeda

Although no [injuries] occurred in the [blast], the [mosque] was se[ve]rely [damaged] and the [bombing] [result]ed in [violence] o[ve]r the [following days]
 O[ve]r 100 [dead bodies] with [bullet holes] were [found] on [February] 23, and at least 16[5] [people] are [thought] to ha[ve] [been] [killed]
 In the [aftermath] of this [attack] the US [military] [calculated] that the [average homicide rate] in [Baghdad] trip[led] from 11 to 33 [deaths] per [day]
 In 2006 the [UN] [described] the [environment] in [Iraq] as a "civil [war]-like [situation]
"
The [current government of Iraq] took [office] on [May] 20, 2006 following [approval] by the [members] of the [Iraq]i National Assembly
 This [followed] the [general election] in [December] 200[5]
 The [government] [succeeded] the [Iraqi Transitional Government] which had [continued] in [office] in a [caretaker capacity] until the [formation] of the [permanent government]

On [November] 23, the deadliest [attack] since the beginning of the [conflict] occurred
 Suspected [Sunni Arab militants] [used] [suicide car bombs] and [mortar rounds] on the [capital]'s [Shia] [Sadr City] slum to kill at least 21[5] [people] and [wound] 2[5]7
 This [attack] was [retaliated] by [Shia militias] who [fire]d [mortar rounds] at [various Sunni neighborhoods] and [organizations]


[Iraq Study Group report] and [Hussein]'s execution

The [Iraq Study Group] Report was [released] on [December] 6, 2006
 [Iraq Study Group], [made] up of [people] from both of the major US [parties], was [led] by [form]er US [Secretary of State James Baker] and [former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton]
 It [concluded] that "the [situation] in [Iraq] is [grave] and [deteriorating]" and "U
S
 [forces] seem to be [caught] in a [mission] that has no [foreseeable end]
" The [report]'s 79 recomm[end]ations include increasing [diplomatic measures] with [Iran] and [Syria] and [intensifying efforts] to train [Iraqi troops]
 On [December] 18, a [Pentagon report] [found] that [insurgent attacks] were a[ve]raging about 960 a [week], the highest since the [reports] had [begun] in 200[5]

[Coalition forces] [form][ally] [transferred control] of a [province] to the [Iraqi government], the first since the [war]
 [Military prosecutors] [charged] eight US [Marines] with the [murders] of 24 [Iraqi civilians] in [Haditha] in [November] 200[5], 10 of them [women] and [children]
 Four [office]rs were also [charged] with [dereliction of duty] in [relation] to the [event]

[Saddam Hussein] was [hanged] on [December] 30, 2006 after being [found] [guilty of crimes] against [humanity] by an [Iraqi court] after a [year]-long trial


2007: US [troop surge]

In a [January] 10, 2007 [televised address] to the US [public], [Bush] proposed 21,[5]00 [more troops] for [Iraq], a [job programme] for [Iraqis], [more reconstruction proposals], and $1
2 billion for these [programmes]
 On [January] 23, 2007 in the 2007 [State] of the [Union Address], [Bush] announced "deploying [reinforcements of more] than 20,000 [additional soldiers] and [Marines] to [Iraq]
"
On [February] 10, 2007 [David Petraeus] was [made commander] of Multi-National Force - [Iraq] (MNF-I), the four-star post that o[ve]rsees all [coalition] [forces] in [country], replacing [General George Casey]
 In his [new position], [Petraeus] o[ve]rsaw all [coalition] [forces] in [Iraq] and [employed] them in the new "Surge" [strategy] [outlined] by the [Bush administration]
 2007 also saw a [sharp increase] in [insurgent chlorine bombings]

On [May] 10, 2007, 144 [Iraqi Parliamentary lawmakers] signed onto a [legislative petition] calling on the [United States] to [set] a [timetable] for [withdrawal]
 On [June] 3, 2007, the [Iraqi Parliament] voted 8[5] to [5]9 to require the [Iraqi government] to consult with [Parliament] before requesting [additional extensions] of the [UN Security Council Mandate] for [Coalition operations] in [Iraq]
 Despite this, the [mandate] was [renewed] on [December] 18, 2007 without the [approval] of the [Iraq]i parliament

[Pressures] on US [troops] were [compounded] by the continuing [withdrawal of British forces] from the [Basra Governorate]
 In early 2007, [British Prime Minister Blair] announced that following [Operation Sinbad British troops] would begin to with[draw] from [Basra], handing [security] o[ve]r to the [Iraqis]

This [announcement] was [confirmed] in the [autumn] by [Prime Minister Gordon Brown], Blair's successor, who again [outlined] a [withdrawal plan] for the [remaining UK forces] with a [complete withdrawal date] some[time] in late 2008
 In [July Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen] also announced the [withdrawal] of 441 [Danish troops] from [Iraq], leaving only a [unit] of nine [soldiers] manning four observational [helicopters]


[Planned troop reduction]

In a [speech] [made] to [Congress] on [September] 10, 2007, [Petraeus] "envisioned the [withdrawal] of roughly 30,000 U
S
 [troops] by [next summer], beginning with a [Marine] contingent in [September]
" On [September] 14, [Bush] [backed] a [limited withdrawal of troops] from [Iraq]

[Bush] [said] [5],700 [personnel] would be [home] by [Christmas] 2007, and [expected thousands] more to return by [July] 2008
 The [plan] would take [troop numbers] back to their [level] before the [surge] at the beginning of 2007
 Contro[ve]rsy arose when [former Secretary of State Colin Powell] announced before the [surge took place] that there would ha[ve] to be a [draw] down of [troops] by mid-2007


[Effects] of the [surge] on [security]

By [March] 2008, [violence] in [Iraq] was [reported] curtai[led] by 40-80%, according to a [Pentagon report]
 [Independent reports] [raised questions] about those [assessments]
 An [Iraqi military spokesman] claimed that [civilian deaths] since the [start] of the [troop surge plan] were 26[5] in [Baghdad], down from 1,440 in the four previous [week]s
 The [New York Times] counted more than 4[5]0 [Iraqi civilians] [killed] during the same 28-[day] [period], [based] on [initial daily reports] from [Iraqi Interior Ministry] and [hospital officials]

Historic[ally], the [daily counts] [tallied] by the [NYT] ha[ve] [underestimated] the [total death toll] by [5]0% or more when [compared] to [studies] by the [United Nations], which rely upon [figures] from the [Iraqi Health Ministry] and [morgue figures]

The [rate] of US [combat deaths] in [Baghdad] nearly doub[led] to 3
14/[day] in the first se[ve]n [week]s of the "[surge]" in [security activity], [compared] to [previous period]
 Across the [rest of Iraq] it reduced s[light]ly

On [August] 14, 2007 the deadliest [single attack] of the [whole war] occurred
 Nearly 800 [civilians] were [killed] by a [series] of co-ordinated suicide [bomb attack]s on the northern [Iraqi settlement of Qahtaniya]
 More than 100 [homes] and [shops] were [destroyed] in the [blasts]
 US [officials] blamed al-Qaeda
 The [targeted villagers] belonged to the non-[Muslim Yazidi ethnic minority]
 The [attack] may ha[ve] [represented] the latest in a [feud] that erupted earlier that [year] when [members] of the [Yazidi community] [stoned] to [death] a teenage [girl] [called] Du'a Khalil Aswad acc[used] of dating a [Sunni Arab man] and [converting] to [Islam]
 The killing of the [girl] was [recorded] on camera-mobiles and the [video] was uploaded onto the [internet]
On [September] 13, 2007 [Abdul Sattar Abu Risha] was [killed] in a [bomb attack] in the [city of Ramadi]
 He was an important US [ally] because he [led] the "[Anbar Awakening]", an [alliance of Sunni Arab tribes] that [opposed] al-Qaeda
 The [latter organisation] claimed [responsibility] for the [attack]
 A [statement] posted on the Internet by the shadowy [Islamic State of Iraq] [called] Abu Risha "one of the [dogs of Bush]" and [described Thursday]'s killing as a "[heroic operation] that took o[ve]r a [month] to prepare"

There was a [reported] [trend of decreasing] US troop [deaths] after [May] 2007, and [violence] against [coalition troops] had [fallen] to the "lowest [levels] since the [first year] of the [American invasion]"
 These, and [several other positive developments], were [attributed] to the [surge] by [many analysts]

[Data] from the [Pentagon] and [other] US [agencies] such as the Go[ve]rnment Account[ability] Office ([GAO]) [found] that [daily attacks] against [civilians] in [Iraq] remained "about the same" since [February]
 The [GAO] also [stated] that there was no [discernible trend] in [sectarian violence]
 Howe[ve]r, this [report] ran [counter] to [reports] to [Congress], which showed a [general downward trend] in [civilian deaths] and ethno-[sectarian violence] since [December] 2006
 By late 2007, as the U
S
 [troop surge] began to wind down, [violence] in [Iraq] had [begun] to [decrease] from its 2006 [highs]

Reports from the [ground dispute] that the [surge] had a [significant effect] on [security] in [Iraq]
 While [life] in [Baghdad] impro[ve]d in 2007-08, the [main reason] this was that the [battle] for [Baghdad] in 2006-07 between the [Shia] and the [Sunni populations] was [won] by the [Shia], who as of [September] 2008 [control][led] three-[quarter]s of the [capital]
 These [demographic changes] appeared permanent; [Sunni families] who try to get their [houses] back [faced assassination]
 Thus the [war] against the US [occupation] by the [Sunni community], who had [been] favoured under [Saddam Hussein], had [large]ly [end]ed
 The [Sunni] ha[ve] [been] [large]ly [defeated], not so much by the US [army] as by the [Shia]-[led] [Iraqi government] and the [Shia militias]

[Entire neighborhoods] in [Baghdad] were ethnic[ally] cleansed by [Shia] and [Sunni militias] and [sectarian violence] has [broken] out in e[ve]ry [Iraqi city] where there is a [mixed population]
 This [assessment] is [supported] by a [study of satellite imagery tracking] the [amount of light emitted] by [Baghdad neighborhoods] at [night]
 The [interpretation] of the data was that [violence] had [declined] in [Baghdad] due to [ethnic cleansing] and that intercommunal [violence] had reached a climax as the [surge] was beginning
 [John Agnew], an [authority] on [ethnic conflict] and [leader] of the [project] [stated] "The [surge] re[ally] seems to ha[ve] [been] a [case of closing] the [stable door] after the [horse] has [bolted]
"
[Investigative reporter Bob Woodward] cites US [government sources] according to which the US "[surge]" was not the [primary reason] for the [drop] in [violence] in 2007-2008
 Instead, according to that [view], the [reduction of violence] was due to [newer covert techniques] by US [military] and [intelligence officials] to find, [target] and kill [insurgents], including [work]ing [close]ly with [former insurgents]

In the [Shia region] near [Basra], [British forces] turned o[ve]r [security] for the [region] to [Iraq]i [Security Forces]
 [Basra] is the [ninth province] of [Iraq]'s 18 [province]s to be [returned] to [local security forces]' [control] since the beginning of the [occupation]


[Political developments]

More than [half] of the [members] of [Iraq]'s parliament rejected the [continuing occupation] of their [country] for the [first time]
 144 of the 27[5] [lawmakers] signed onto a [legislative petition] that would require the [Iraqi government] to seek [approval] from [Parliament] before it requests an [extension] of the U
N
 [mandate] for [foreign forces] to be in [Iraq], which expires at the [end] of 2008
 It also calls for a [timetable] for [troop withdrawal] and a [freeze] on the [size of foreign forces]
 The U
N
 [Security Council mandate] for U
S
-[led] [forces] in [Iraq] will terminate "if [requested] by the [government of Iraq]
" Under [Iraqi law], the [speaker] must present a [resolution] [called] for by a [majority of lawmakers]
 [5]9% of those [polled] in the U
S
 support a [timetable] for [withdrawal]

In mid-2007, the Coalition began a [controversial program] to recruit [Iraqi Sunnis] (often [former insurgents]) for the [formation] of "Guardian" [militias]
 These [Guardian militias] are [intended] to support and secure [various Sunni neighborhoods] against the [Islamists]


[Tensions] with [Iran]

In 2007, tensions [increased] greatly between [Iran] and [Iraqi Kurdistan due] to the latter's giving sanctuary to the [militant Kurdish secessionist group Party] for a [Free Life] in Kurdistan (PEJAK
) According to [reports], [Iran] had [been] shelling [PEJAK positions] in [Iraqi Kurdistan] since [August] 16
 These tensions further [increased] with an [alleged border incursion] on [August] 23 by [Iranian troops] who [attack]ed [several Kurdish villages] killing an [unknown number of civilians] and [militants]

[Coalition forces] also began to [target] [alleged Iranian Quds force operatives] in [Iraq], either [arresting] or [killing suspected members]
 The [Bush administration] and [coalition leaders] began to [public]ly state that [Iran] was supplying [weapons], [part]icularly [EFP devices], to [Iraqi insurgents] and [militias] although to date ha[ve] [failed] to provide any [proof] for these [allegations]
 Further [sanctions] on [Iranian organizations] were also announced by the [Bush administration] in the Autumn of 2007
 On [November] 21, 2007 [Lieutenant General James Dubik], who is in [charge of training Iraqi security forces], praised [Iran] for its "[contribution] to the [reduction of violence]" in [Iraq] by upholding its [pledge] to stop the [flow of weapons], [explosives] and [training of extremists] in [Iraq]


[Tensions] with [Turkey]

[Border incursions] by [PKK militants] [based] in [Iraqi Kurdistan] ha[ve] [continued] to harass [Turkish forces], with [casualties] on both [sides] increasing tensions between [Turkey], a [NATO member], and [Iraqi Kurdistan]

In the [fall] of 2007, the Turkish [military] [stated] their [right] to cross the [Iraqi Kurdistan border] in "[hot pursuit]" of [PKK militants] and began shelling [Kurdish villages] in [Iraq] and [attacking PKK bases] in the [Mount Cudi region] with [aircraft]
 The Turkish parliament [approved] a [resolution] permitting the [military] to pursue the [PKK] in [Iraqi Kurdistan]
 In [November], [Turkish gunships] [attack]ed [parts of northern Iraq] in the [first such attack] by [Turkish aircraft] since the [border tensions] [escalated]
 An[other] [series of attacks] in mid-[December] hit [PKK targets] in the [Qandil], [Zap], [Avashin] and [Hakurk regions]
 The [latest series of attacks involved] at least [5]0 [aircraft] and [artillery] and [Kurdish officials] [reported] one [civilian] [killed] and two [wounded]

Addition[ally], [weapons] that were [given] to [Iraqi security forces] by the US [military are] being [recovered] by [authorities] in [Turkey] after being [used] in that state


[Private security firm controversy]

On [September] 17, 2007, the [Iraqi government] announced that it was revoking the [license] of the US [security firm Blackwater USA] o[ve]r the [firm]'s invol[ve]ment in the killing of eight [civilians], including a [woman] and an [infant], in a [firefight] that [followed] a [car bomb explosion] near a [State Department motorcade]
 [Additional investigations of alleged arms smuggling involving] the [firm] was also under [way]
 [Blackwater] is currently one of the most high-profile [firm]s operating in [Iraq], with around 1,000 [employees] as well as a [fleet of helicopters] in the [country]
 Whether the [group] may be leg[ally] [prosecuted] is still a matter of [debate]


2008: [Iraqi forces arm]

Throughout 2008, U
S
 [officials] and [independent think tanks] began to [point] to [improvements] in the [security situation], as [measured] by [key statistics]
 According to the US [Defense Department], in [December] 2008 the "[overall level of violence]" in the [country] had [dropped] 80% since before the [surge] began in [January] 2007, and the [country]'s [murder rate] had [dropped] to pre-[war levels]
 They also [point]ed out that the [casualty figure] for U
S
 [forces] in 2008 was 314 against a [figure] of 904 in 2007
 According to the [Brookings Institution], [Iraqi civilian fatalities] [numbered] 490 in [November] 2008 as against 3,[5]00 in [January] 2007, whereas [attacks] against the [coalition] [numbered] somewhere between 200 and 300 per [week] in the [latter half] of 2008, as [opposed] to a peak of nearly 1,600 in [summer] 2007
 The [number of Iraqi security forces killed] was under 100 per [month] in the [second half] of 2008, from a high of 200 to 300 in [summer] 2007

Meanwhile, the [proficiency] of the [Iraq]i [military] [increased] as it [launched] a [spring] [offensive] against [Shia militias] which [Prime Minister] Nouri al-Maliki had previously [been] criticized for allowing to ope[rate]
 This began with a [March operation] against the [Mehdi Army] in [Basra], which [led] to [fight]ing in [Shia areas] up and down the [country], especi[ally] in the Sadr [City district of Baghdad]
 By [October], the [British officer] in [charge of Basra] [said] that since the [operation] the [town] had [become] "secure" and had a [murder rate] comparable to [Manchester] in [England]
 The U
S
 [military] also [said] there had [been] a [decrease] of about a [quarter] in the [quantity] of [Iran]ian-[made explosives] [found] in [Iraq] in 2008, possibly indicating a [change] in [Iranian policy]
 [Progress] in [Sunni areas] [continued] after [members] of the [Awakening movement] were [transferred] from U
S
 [military] to [Iraqi control]
 In [May], the [Iraqi army] - [backed] by [coalition support] - [launched] an [offensive] in [Mosul], the [last major Iraqi stronghold] of al-Qaeda
 Despite detaining [thousands of individuals], the [offensive] [failed] to lead to major long-term [security] [improvements] in [Mosul]
 At the [end] of the [year], the [city] remained a [major flashpoint]

In the [regional dimension], the [ongoing conflict] between [Turkey] and [PKK] intensified on [February] 21, when [Turkey] [launched] a [ground attack] into the [Quandeel Mountains of Northern Iraq]
 In the nine [day] long [operation], around 10,000 [Turkish troops] advanced up to 2[5] km into Northern [Iraq]
 This was the [first substantial ground incursion] by [Turkish forces] since 199[5]
 Shortly after the [incursion] began, both the [Iraqi cabinet] and the Kurdistan [region]al [government] condemned [Turkey]'s actions and [called] for the [immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops] from the [region]
 [Turkish troops] withdrew on [February] 29
 The [fate] of the [Kurds] and the [future] of the ethnic[ally]-[diverse city of Kirkuk] remained a [contentious issue] in [Iraqi politics]

U
S
 [military officials] met these [trends] with [cautious optimism] as they approached what they [described] as the "[transition]" [embodied] in the U
S
-[Iraq Status of Forces Agreement] which was [negotiated] throughout 2008
 The [commander] of the [coalition], U
S
 General Raymond T
 Odierno, noted that "in [military terms], [transitions] are the most [dangerous time]" in [December] 2008


[Spring offensives] on [Shia militias]

At the [end of March], the [Iraq]i Army, with [Coalition air support], [launched] an [offensive], dubbed "Charge of the [Knights]", in [Basra] to secure the [area] from [militias]
 This was the [first major operation] where the [Iraq]i Army did not ha[ve] [direct combat support] from [conventional coalition ground troops]
 The [offensive] was [opposed] by the [Mahdi Army], one of the [militias], which [control][led] much of the [region]
 [Fighting] [quick]ly spread to [other parts of Iraq]: including [Sadr City], [Al Kut], [Al Hillah] and [others]
 During the [fighting Iraqi forces met stiff resistance] from [militiamen] in [Basra] to the [point] that the [Iraqi military offensive] slowed to a crawl, with the [high attrition rates] fin[ally] forcing the [Sadrists] to the [negotiating table]

Following [talks] with [Brig]
 Gen
 Qassem Suleimani, [commander] of the [Qods brigades] of [Iran]'s Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the [intercession] of the [Iranian government], on [March] 31, 2008, al-Sadr [order]ed his [followers] to [ceasefire]
 The [militiamen] kept their [weapons]

By [May] 12, 2008, [Basra] "[residents] o[ve]rwhelmingly [reported] a [substantial improvement] in their [everyday lives]" according to The [New York Times]
 "[Government forces] ha[ve] now [taken] o[ve]r [Islam]ic [militants]' head[quarter]s and [halted] the [death squads] and '[vice enforcers]' who [attack]ed [women], [Christians], [musicians], [alcohol sellers] and [anyone suspected of collaborating] with [Westerners]", according to the [report]; howe[ve]r, when asked how long it would take for [lawlessness] to resume if the [Iraqi army] [left], one resident replied, "one [day]"

In [late April roadside bombings] [continued] to rise from a low in [January] of 114 to o[ve]r 2[5]0, surpassing the [May] 2007 high

In [early May], the [Iraqi government] [called] on the [residents of Sadr City] to flee after more than 40 [days of fighting], which [left] between [5]00-1,000 [people] dead
 Due to the nearly [constant violence], there are [ongoing shortages of food], [water], and [other supplies]


[Congressional testimony]

Speaking before the U
S
 [Congress] on [April] 8, 2008, [General David Petraeus] urged delaying [troop withdrawals], saying, "I'[ve] repeatedly noted that we [haven]'t turned any [corners], we [haven]'t [seen] any [lights] at the [end] of the [tunnel]," referencing the [comments] of then [President Bush] and [form]er [Vietnam]-era General William Westmoreland
 When asked by [Senator Evan Bayh] if [reasonable people] could disagree on the [way] for[war]d, [Petraeus] responded, "I don't [know] if I would go that far
" When asked twice again about that [point], [Petraeus] [said], "We [fight] for the [right of people] to ha[ve] [other opinions]
"
Upon [question]ing by then [Senate committee chair Joe Biden], [Ambassador Crocker] admitted that Al-Qaeda in [Iraq] was less important than the Al-Qaeda organization [led] by [Osama bin Laden] along the Afghan-Pakistani [border]
 Lawmakers from both [parties] complained that U
S
 [taxpayers] are carrying [Iraq]'s burden as it earns [billions of dollars] in [oil revenues]
 [Democrats plan] to push [legislation] this [spring] that would force the [Iraqi government] to sp[end] its [own surplus] to rebuild


[Iraqi security forces] rearm

[Iraq] became one of the [top current purchasers] of U
S
 [military equipment] with their [army] trading its AK-47 [assault rifles] for the U
S
 M-16 and M-4 rifles, among [other equipment]
 This [year] alone, [Iraq accounts] for more than $12
[5] billion of the $34 billion US [weapon sales] to [foreign countries] (not including the potential F-16 [fight]er [plan]es
)
[Iraq] sought 36 F-16's, the most [sophisticated weapons system Iraq] has [attempted] to purchase
 The [Pentagon notified Congress] that it
